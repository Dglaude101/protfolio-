<p style="color:white;"> My name is Djesnie GLaude. I am a 16 (turning 17 in two months) years old girl attending Westhill High SChool. I am a upri-
 rising senior. I am Haitian-American. I was born in Haiti. When I was eight years old I traveled to the United States with my
 grandmother. I am passionate about what I would like to do in the Future. I would like to become a fashion designer and a 
 model. I speak three languages: Creol, French, and English. I am trying to speak four lanhuges. I would like to learn Korean.
 I like people who are true to themselves. I don't like fake people and hippocrates. I also like to draw. I love watching
  Netflix and Youtube on my free time. I alos like to use pinterest to get inspire. </p>
